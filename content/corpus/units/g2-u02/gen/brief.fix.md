# Shared content rules (every generator and fixer reads these)

You are authoring practice items for Austrian AHS students (10–14, EFL, MORE! textbooks,
A1→A2). A broken item in front of a child is the failure that matters most. The v1 app
died on content quality — these rules are the law:

1. **The textbook is the source of truth.** Carrier sentences come from the textbook
   FIRST: the master list's example sentence (`exampleSb`), then a sentence from the
   SB/WB transcript (verbatim or minimally adapted), invention is the LAST resort.
   Record honestly in `sSource`/`sbRef`: `masterlist` | `sb` | `wb` | `invented`.
2. **The cumulative word bank is the level gate.** Every English word a student sees
   (carriers, definitions, distractors, options, pair sides, group members) must be
   taught at or below this unit — the brief lists the allowed vocabulary. Anything
   above level MUST carry an inline gloss recorded in the item's `gloss[]` array and
   appear in the text exactly as written. Glossing is the exception, not the routine:
   prefer rephrasing with taught words. A deterministic validator REJECTS any unglossed
   unknown token — do not gamble.
3. **Answer sets are forgiving and correct.** Accept EVERY variant that is correct in
   the sentence (tier `full`); near-synonyms / reasonable-but-imperfect alternatives go
   in as tier `partial`. Never demand a citation form that makes the sentence
   ungrammatical. Spelling tolerance (`close`) is computed by the grader — never author
   misspellings.
4. **German is informal du-form, always.** Never "Sie/Ihnen/Ihr" as address. Natural,
   age-appropriate German (Austrian standard; ß/ä/ö/ü correct — never ASCII "ue").
5. **Zero meta-talk in student-facing carriers.** No grammar terminology in prompts,
   carriers, answers, distractors, options ("past simple", "modal verb", …) — the task
   shows, it never lectures. Instruction text lives in the renderer, NOT in your prompt
   text. EXCEPTION: `hintDe`/`explainDe` MAY use the light German grammar vocabulary the
   textbook itself uses (Grundform, Vergangenheit, Verneinung …) — English grammar
   jargon is banned even there.
6. **v1 seeds are UNTRUSTED.** The brief includes v1 items as idea material. Known v1
   defect classes: invented above-level carrier words, out-of-bank MC distractors,
   over-strict answer sets, meta-talk. Mine them; never copy unverified.
7. **Distractors are real words from the bank**, plausible but unambiguously wrong in
   context, never lemma-variants of an accepted answer.
8. **Pairs and groups are English↔English** (sentence halves, question↔answer,
   category sorting). German belongs in translation surfaces only.
9. **Difficulty is honest:** 1 = recognition/single-token, 2 = guided production,
   3 = free production / multi-step. Spread items across difficulties.
10. **Blanks** are `___` (3+ underscores). Multi-blank answers join per-blank fills
    with ` | ` in blank order.

# Item fix round

The items below were flagged by independent verification lenses (or the review). Fix
ONLY these items; do not touch anything else. For each item:

- Read every flag and its note — the lens says what is wrong, you decide the best fix
  that satisfies ALL the shared rules at once (a fix that creates a new level-gate
  violation is not a fix).
- Keep the item's id, structure, format and pedagogical intent. If the flag is about
  the carrier, prefer the smallest change that resolves it (often: swap one word for a
  taught one, or add the missing gloss). If an answer set is incomplete, extend it —
  do not narrow correct answers away.
- If the flagged item is unsalvageable in its format, you may rebuild its content
  completely (same id, same structureId; new carrier/answers) — say so in `note`.

Return ONLY the fixed items, by id, in the fix-draft shape stated in the brief.

## Flagged items

### `g2u02.gi.irregular-verbs.mc.003`
- [lens:answers] **distractor-plausible-correct**: Carrier "Mrs Wu ___ a big cake for the children." with answer "made". The distractor "bought" is a fully grammatical, idiomatic past-tense fit: "Mrs Wu bought a big cake for the children" is a completely natural sentence (you can buy a cake just as readily as bake one), and there is no time/agreement cue forcing made over bought. A student picking "bought" is defensibly correct. Contrast mc.002 where the parallel distractor "made a long letter" is a collocation error and stays safe.
